## BUSINESS INTERNET CONCEPTS — EXPERT KNOWLEDGE

### Shared vs. Dedicated Internet
- **Shared (Broadband):** Bandwidth is shared with other users on the same node. Speeds can slow during peak hours. More affordable. Fine for most small businesses.
- **Dedicated (DIA):** Your bandwidth is yours alone — guaranteed speeds 24/7. Required for businesses running VoIP systems, cloud apps, video conferencing, or handling sensitive data. Comes with SLAs and proactive monitoring.

### Fiber vs. Cable vs. Fixed Wireless vs. Satellite
- **Fiber:** Fastest, most reliable. Symmetric speeds. Lowest latency (~1-5ms). Best for businesses that can get it.
- **Cable (HFC):** Widely available. Good speeds but asymmetric (upload much slower than download). Slightly higher latency (~10-30ms). Reliable for most business needs.
- **Fixed Wireless:** Quick installation (days, not weeks). Good where wired options are limited. Latency varies (~10-50ms). Can be affected by weather/line-of-sight.
- **5G Fixed Wireless:** T-Mobile and others. Very quick self-setup. Good speeds but can vary. Great as primary for light usage or as failover.
- **Satellite:** Available everywhere. High latency (~600ms) makes real-time apps difficult. Best as last resort or backup for remote locations.
- **DSL:** Legacy technology, being phased out. Slower speeds, uses phone lines. Still available from Frontier/Windstream in some areas.

### What Speed Does My Business Need?
- **1-5 employees, basic usage (email, web, POS):** 50-100 Mbps
- **5-15 employees, moderate usage (cloud apps, video calls):** 100-300 Mbps
- **15-50 employees, heavy usage (large file transfers, multiple video calls):** 300 Mbps–1 Gbps
- **50+ employees or bandwidth-critical operations:** 1 Gbps dedicated or higher
- **Multi-location / enterprise:** Dedicated fiber + SD-WAN

### Why Upload Speed Matters
Many businesses focus on download speed but upload is critical for:
- Video conferencing (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet)
- Uploading files to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- Cloud-based POS and inventory systems
- VoIP phone calls
- Backing up data to the cloud
- Sending large email attachments

**Rule of thumb:** If your team does a lot of video calls or cloud work, prioritize fiber (symmetric) over cable (asymmetric).

### Static IP Addresses
A static IP is an IP address that doesn't change. Needed for:
- Hosting a website or email server on-premises
- VPN access for remote workers
- Security cameras accessible remotely
- Point-of-sale (POS) systems
- Certain compliance requirements (HIPAA, PCI-DSS)

Most providers include a static IP on mid-tier+ plans or offer it as an add-on ($5-15/month).

### SLA (Service Level Agreement) Explained
An SLA is a contractual guarantee from the provider:
- **99.9% uptime** = up to 8.76 hours of downtime per year
- **99.99% uptime** = up to 52.6 minutes of downtime per year
- **99.999% uptime** = up to 5.26 minutes of downtime per year

Dedicated fiber plans typically come with 99.99% SLAs and service credits if the provider fails to meet them. Broadband plans usually have 99.9% or no formal SLA.

### Redundancy and Failover
For businesses where downtime costs money, we recommend:
1. **Primary:** Dedicated fiber or fiber broadband
2. **Secondary:** Cable broadband or T-Mobile 5G (different infrastructure/path)
3. **SD-WAN:** To automatically failover between connections seamlessly

This dual-WAN or SD-WAN setup ensures your business stays connected even if one provider has an outage.

### VoIP / UCaaS Considerations
Voice over IP (VoIP) requires:
- Minimum 100 Kbps upload per concurrent call
- Low latency (<150ms one-way)
- Low jitter (<30ms)
- QoS (Quality of Service) prioritization

Cable and fiber both work well for VoIP. Satellite does NOT work well for VoIP due to latency. Fixed wireless is acceptable if latency is under 50ms.

### Common Business Internet Pain Points We Solve
1. **"My internet is too slow"** → We find faster options from multiple providers
2. **"I'm paying too much"** → We comparison-shop 28+ providers for the best rate
3. **"Installation takes weeks"** → Many of our partners offer same-day/next-day install
4. **"I can't get fiber at my location"** → We check all providers including fixed wireless and satellite options
5. **"I need a backup connection"** → We set up dual-WAN with SD-WAN failover
6. **"I'm opening a new location"** → We handle multi-site quoting and provisioning
7. **"My VoIP quality is bad"** → We recommend the right connection type and QoS configuration

## SALES PROCESS

1. **Check Availability:** Customer enters their address on our website
2. **Review Options:** We show all available providers and plans at that location
3. **Expert Consultation:** Our team (or this AI assistant) helps compare options
4. **Order:** Customer selects a plan and we place the order with the provider
5. **Installation:** Provider schedules and completes installation (often within 24 hours)
6. **Ongoing Support:** We remain the customer's advocate for the life of the service

**We never charge the customer extra.** Our service is free because providers pay us a referral/commission. The customer always gets the same price (or better) as going directly to the provider.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Is there a contract?**
A: Most of our broadband partners offer month-to-month service with no annual contract. Dedicated fiber services typically have 1-3 year terms due to the infrastructure investment.

**Q: How fast can I get installed?**
A: Many broadband providers offer same-day or next-day installation. Dedicated fiber can take 30-90 days for new construction, but existing lit buildings can be activated in days.

**Q: Do you serve residential customers?**
A: We specialize in business internet. For residential needs, we recommend contacting providers directly.

**Q: Can I bundle internet with phone and TV?**
A: Yes! Many of our partners offer bundles. Spectrum, Cox, Comcast, and others offer internet + voice + TV packages with meaningful discounts.

**Q: What if I need service at multiple locations?**
A: We specialize in multi-location deployments. We can mix providers across locations to get the best combination of speed, price, and reliability at each site, then tie them together with SD-WAN if needed.

**Q: How do I know which provider is best for me?**
A: Start by checking availability at your address. Then consider: What speed do you need? Is upload speed important? Do you need an SLA? What's your budget? Our AI assistant and sales team can help you through this decision.
